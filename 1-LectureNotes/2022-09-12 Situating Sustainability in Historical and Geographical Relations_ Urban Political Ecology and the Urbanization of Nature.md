[[Urban Political Ecology. Theoretical concepts, challenges, and suggested future directions]]

**Core idea: The urbanization of the nature is the transition of the nature.

## Urban Political Ecology, reading 1 & 2
### Start points
Binary categories (Using dualism 二元论)
* Nature
* Society 
> like mind & body

>Nature provided a good outlet to the Gulf

Goya's Art "Fight with cudgels" reflected the history of people fights

### Cases Study
#### Chicago Nature's Metropolis
> Nature is made of the Social, not the original nature
>
> The railroads of Chicago are investigated, capital of the property

#### Production of wheat : First to second nature
After the nature was mobilized or hybridized or metabolism (by capital) , then turn to the second 

Take the wheat to market→ railway→wheat elevator→wheat become the commodities
the relationship between wheat and the farmland is the changed and wheat were generated to the commodities then

<u> So this is the process from first to second nature, the urbanization of the nature</u> 
Then the second nature mobilized to the country or the city.

According to the Reading3, the city is not something moving around inside (**from the city to the society**)

The design of the city concludes thinking of how capital drives different stuffs

#### The production of meat
Second nature: use the cooling system to transport it to other places.


### Entry points:
Compare and contract: Discuss the state of “nature”... in relation to capital
	•Cronon: “first” and “second” nature  
	•Process: Capital mobilizing the country and its resources.


### Bruno Latour's Points
Society and nature  < -- > Purification and Hybridization


## Extended urbanization & Planetary urbanization

pipes in the city for water infrastructure
Dams for protection from water or generate e-power
Like tesla E-car 

The capital of the East coast of the US, like NYC, can drive the transition in Chicago and transport it to mid/west American

implosion (intensification, an inward movement)

### Arboleda, Martin: Urban as a machine
Homogenization 均质化 - Fragmentation 异质化 - Fragmentation
	* Spatial Homogenization
	* Territorial Fragmentation
	* Fragmentation
* Urbanization is an expanding process towards a machine, a factory
	* like the Foodora delivery is a kind of literary "mining", driven by capital platform

So the sustainability we talk about is landscape that human build, or the sustainability of the human labor.
