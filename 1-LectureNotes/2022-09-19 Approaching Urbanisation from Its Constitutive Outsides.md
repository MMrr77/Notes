#### Section 1: Constitutive outsides as entry point
##### reproduction of the modern city:
* like the food reproduce in women
> last week talking about commodity within capital
> this week is the constitutive outside the capital

* energy poverty in UK
* choses for lower income women : a cellphone for job market or food for kids
* the metabolism of production flow
* regard a work family as a unit

##### A1 Feminist political ecology
> 跌倒在metabolism of production flow 并溺死的女人

在资本的积累和流通过程中忽略了女性为家庭的支撑而没有得到支付的环节

##### A2 Postcolonial Urban Political Ecology
* the labour (young men or women) just give the number and almost given without value
* sugar production: white supremacist (白人至上主义)
* behind the thing itself is the relationship
* still exist in modern UE factory 

##### A3 Abolitionist Political 废奴主义政治生态学

##### Summarizing
==Starting from Constitutive Outsides open doors to rethink the city and from where to re-think the city==

• Foregrounding REPRODUCTION, the HOUSEHOLD and the BODY as ”metabolic” moments (Doshi ”embodied UPE”)
• How Western capital accumulation and urbanisation of nature is founded on subjugation of women, slave-trade and the stealing of land.
• The linking of uneven urbanisation (production of commodities (by enslaved, bondage, “developing” countries) to consumption (by workers in "developed” countries) (see classic Sidney Mintz’ Sweetness of Sugar)
• What are the ACTIVE REMAINS of this historical mode of production and subjugation of people and ecosystems?
• How have these global connections pre-figured and become institutionalised in urban forms – as “plant-age urbanism” and the ghetto (Heynen), as a “settler public sphere” (Lalu) that filters out violence and inequality.

#### Section 2: Guided by Southern Urbanism: Towards Situated UPE
