#### ## Abstract

This commentary makes a case for a more rigorous treatment of the body as a material and political site within the sub-ﬁeld of urban political ecology. I propose an embodied urban political ecology grounded in a feminist, anti-racist and postcolonial approach consisting of ﬁve orienting propositions. They include attention to metabolism, social reproduction, intersectionality and articulation, emotion and affect, and political subjectivity. Although applicable to political ecology broadly, I focus on the urban because of how often the body is mobilised in conceptualisations of cities and infrastructure despite the fact that material embodiment remains under-studied and disparately theorised in the subﬁeld. I suggest that theoretical and empirical attention to embodiment in these ﬁve key arenas can deepen understandings of the terrain of environmental politics and potential transformation within the subﬁeld of urban political ecology.

#### 概念
* Embodied ecology (具身生态学)
> 1. Fluidity between bodies and worlds involves both what surrounds bodies and what composes (or resides within) them;
> 2. Thinking with ecologies encompasses both bodies and environments, emphasizing relations instead of entities. Humans are not coherent objects set against the background of their environment, but are relationally implicated _with_ it (and each other);
> 3. When relations are prioritized, distinctions between material substance and immaterial experience become blurry. Embodied ecologies are decidedly non-Cartesian.

Embodiment helps avert （避免） dualistic framing （二元框架）that oppose docility （顺从）and resistance（抵抗）

#### 观点
* 1. Metabolism is embodied politics not just a metaphor
> 新陈代谢是政治的体现，而不仅仅是一个隐喻
* 2. Social reproduction matters for urban ecology
>社会再生产对城市生态很重要
* 3. Multiple, interconnected relations of difference and power shape urban ecologies
> 差异和权力的多重、相互关联的关系塑造了城市生态
* 4. Affect and emotion are also material and embodied
> 感情影响和情感也是物质的和具身的
* 5. Bodies are sites for the formation of political subjectivities with sometimes contradictory desires
>身体是形成政治主体性的场所，有时具有相互矛盾的欲望

Embodied ecology
water - pipes - urban, these infra are invisible
water - people, labour - urban(house), these are visible --> which is called "people as infrastructure"
- Marist is the structuralist theory ,是自上而下的
- Poststructure 是自下而上的讨论社会的资本，like infrastructure
