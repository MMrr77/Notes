#### 背景
Henri Lefebvre was the first person to transcribe Marxian discourse into spatial terms, demonstrating that space becomes an abstract category necessary for the reproduction of capitalist relations.

#### Abstract

Urbanization today, now that it has become generalized, is mainly suburbanization in its manifold differentiation. As suburbanization becomes the form and suburbanism becomes the life of much of the urban revolution, we are entering an age of postsuburbanization. <u>This means, for example, that the notion of suburbanization as dependent on one centre has to be discarded as the form and life of the global suburb take shape in a general dynamics of multiple centralities and decentralities.</u> It includes a maturation of classical suburbia, a more splintered and fragmented urbanism. This paper reviews aspects of a ==Lefebvrian== discussion around these issues and focuses in on the explosion and subsequent reassembly of “disjunct fragments” of the urban in a world of global suburbanisms. In so far as it challenges the traditional view of the central-peripheral urban dialectics, it intersects with debates on planetary urbanization. The paper ends with speculations on the horizontalization of sub/urban form and practice in a globalizing world.

*依赖于一个中心(one center)的郊区化（suburbanisation）必须被抛弃 (discarded)
因为全球郊区的形式和生活在多重中心和分散的一般动态中形成。*


本文回顾了围绕这些问题的列斐伏尔式讨论的各个方面，并着重于全球郊区主义世界中城市“不连贯的碎片”的爆炸和随后的重组。就它挑战中部-外围城市辩证法（central-peripheral urban dialectics）的传统观点而言，它与关于行星城市化（planetary urbanization）的辩论交叉。本文以对全球化世界中郊区/城市形态（sub/urban form）和实践的水平化horizontalization的思考作为结尾。 

The tendency towards fragmentation is based on the social and spatial concentration of capital, but this does not mean these fragments around the central urban.

* If the Lefebvre's notion of complete urbanization acknowledges variety and diversity of morphologies, infrastructure and sub/urban, it is most useful. (但实际上不)

#### Introduction
* "planetary urbanization" is a context （<u> But the author criticizes the theory </u> ）
	* and hold the view that <u> suburbanization and suburbanism cannot be fully subsumed under the notion of "planetary urbanization" and "extended urbanization"</u>
	* 尽管几种框架是一样的
* “completely urbanized society” is undisputed.（毋庸置疑的）
* Most scholar remains a largely underexposed（曝光不足） understanding of the urban periphery (外围)
* ==方法：对郊区化的具体过程进行实证研究再将具体过程理论化==，empirical study of concrete processes of suburbanization and for theorization from those concrete processes.

##### 行文逻辑
1. Define and explain the notion with suburbanzation and suburbanisms
2. Discuss the intersects between "Henri Lefebvre’s vision of a completely urbanized society" and "ongoing suburbanization"
	By talking about the core theoretical questions in urban theory.
3. How a deeply understanding of suburbanization helps a more critical approach to  practice of urban politics today.

#### Planetary suburbanization – Global suburbanisms 概念和术语
*   Urbanization today: 
	* 1. sociodemographic change from rural to urban （rural -> urban 社会人口变化)
	* 2.economic industrialization and ultimately post-industrialization 经济工业化及后工业化
	* 3.socio-cultural change (often also identiﬁed with urbanism)
