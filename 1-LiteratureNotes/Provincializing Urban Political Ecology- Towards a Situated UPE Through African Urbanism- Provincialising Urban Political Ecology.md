#### ## Abstract

Urban political ecology (UPE) has provided critical insights into the sociomaterial construction *（社会物质建设）* of urban environments, their unequal distribution of resources *（资源的不公平分配）*, and contestation争论 over power and resources *（资源与权利之争）*. Most of this work is rooted in Marxist urban geographical theory, which provides a useful but limited analysis. Such works typically begin with a historical-materialist theory of power, then examine particular artifacts and infrastructure to provide a critique of society. We argue that there are multiple ways of expanding this framing, including through political ecology or wider currents of Marxism. Here, we demonstrate one possibility: starting from theory and empirics in the South, speciﬁcally, African urbanism. We show how African urbanism can inform UPE and the associated research methods, theory and practice to create a more situated UPE. <u> We begin suggesting what a situated UPE might entail: starting with everyday practices  </u>*（从日常实践开始）, *  <u> examining diffuse forms of power </u> *（研究权利的分散形式）*, and <u> opening the scope for radical incrementalism  </u>*（并为激进的渐进注意开辟了空间）*

#### Key Trends in Political Ecological Research
##### 1. historical-materialist
> deﬁned by primary attention to structures of power and dialectical reasoning and places their explanations in reference to an historically shaped economic structure of capital, labour, land and the state, seen to originate from a process of capital accumulation.
##### 2.poststructuralist insights
> to diffuse forms of power, uses ethnographic approaches and postcolonial and feminist critiques of knowledge production;


#### Urban political Eclogy	（Typical Argument underlined below 3 points）

The ==urbanization of nature==, or the social, cultural, and political ==relations== through which ==material and biophysical entities become transformed in the making of often unequal cities==.

- <u> historical-materialist notion of power </u>; # A notion of power derived from Marxist analysis of capital accumulation
>历史唯物主义的权力观念；# 权利源自于马克思主义对资本积累的分析的概念
- <u> a focus on artifacts as object of analysis, in particular networked infrastructure </u>; # Examining particular artifacts (in particular networked infrastructures) as objects of analysis to examine the material ﬂows and processes that shape the city in order to provide
>将artifacts作为分析对象，特别是网络基础设施；检查塑造城市的物质流动和过程，以便提供特定的artifacts
* <u> a critique of capitalism, modernity, and/or neoliberalism </u>
> 对资本主义，商品化，现代化和新自由主义的批判

##### Historical-Materialist Notions of Power
在历史唯物主义的背景下，资本积累被理解为阻止城市的主要潜在力量，影响文化和社会形态。这种方式可以将城市化看成是form “structures”。虽然能够解释UPE和权利概念的基础，但也仅是历史唯物主义所涵盖的几个方面。但结合poststructuralism 的UPE可以更好的描述 how capitalism mobilizes a multitude of things, discourses, and people—into hybrids, assemblages or quasi-objects—to stabilize infrastructures, modes of governing, and problem deﬁnition

##### Object of Analysis: Metabolism and Circulation of Artifacts and Infrastructure
UPE looks to the process which power redirects meterial flows, including metabolism and circulation.<u> material (re)production of the city </u>, <u> domestication of nature </u>,  <u> produce commodities with use and exchange values </u>
> 新陈代谢城市化将其分为文化的和生物物理的，两者中没有明显界限

which makes the INFRASTRUCTURE of city the CENTRAL of UPE
Artifacts不只是基础设施，当然水、草坪是蓝绿基础设施，而食品和脂肪的物质流动也是例子

##### From Theory to Practice: Critique and Systemic Change
- Marxist leads UPE scholar towards a larger critique of the operation of Capital
- The critique varies: <u> Capitalism </u>, <u> Neoliberalism </u>, <u> modernity </u>

##### Possibilities for a More Heterogenous UPE  *UPE 的异质性*
- 1. The diverse post-structuralist insights of political ecology, such as feminist thinking
- 2. The Growing literatrue on UPE in South Asia: The postcolonial thinking with UPE 
- 3. Draw on wider currents of Marxism
- 4. What this paper is talking about: the theoretical insightes on African Urbanism


#### Key Insights from African Urbanism
* Based on the UPE theories on global north, the southern urbanist hope to find notion common in urban studies, but failed. 这篇文章是在这些基础上希望非洲都市主义做建设意见


#### Situating UPE through African Urbanism
Starting with examining everyday practices of African cities rather than starting with a theory of urbanization. Which is SITUATED UPE

##### Object of Analysis: Everyday Practices
按理说是从infrastructure切入进行，但是由于南非实在缺乏这样的基础设施条件，因此考虑从日常实践切入
![[A simpliﬁed overview of Urban Political Ecology as currently practiced (left side) and a situated UPE (right side).png]]
Taking alcohol as the example of everyday practice in Cape Town.
- The access of water might be positive in UPE, but the access of alcohol becomes more controversial.
- How is the political ecology of alcohol flows


##### Power as Diffuse and Relational
- To reformulate the understanding of how power operates, including other forms of identity (like race and gender), and discursice power and knowledge claims
- The water provatization of South Africa --> to suggest the primacy of racial explanation
- 如巴西里约的slum中， 性别、年龄等对社会空间的话语权不同

##### From Theory to Practice: Radical Incrementalism 激进的增量主义
Something i cannot understand, but might be related to the power
#### Conclusion
* They argued for the **procincialize UPE** (地方化)
* adding insights from African urbanism requires expanding the core elements of UPE to provide a more situated UPE.
* Some of the African urban works demonstrated the limitation of historical-materialist explanations of Affican urbanism, showing how starting with everyday practice.
* the new form of power is diffuse, 权力形式是分散的
