当下看sustainable的malmo和长远看的sustainable

**Why is the global north the right example?**




#### Abstract

When cities in the global north are considered environmental sustainable, this largely depends on how one measures emissions and understands space. Production-based and consumption-based approaches are two di erent ways of measuring emissions, but they are not simply measuring techniques: they relate also to di erent interests, they hide and reveal power relations, and they come with very di erent spatial implications. In this paper, we examine the Swedish city of Malmö, and the city district of Western Harbour in particular, which is often considered an environmental ‘role model’. We argue that this reputation depends precisely upon how we understand space and measure emissions. We argue that so-called sustainable cities and city districts in the global north can only be considered environmental role models if one chose to ignore the fact that they completely depend upon emissions being emitted elsewhere, and ignore any relation between a uence and emissions.
